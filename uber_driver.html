        <h2>How I convinced Uber Drivers to Teach Me How to Drive</h2>

        <h3 style = "color:rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">October 1st, 2018</h3>

        <p>

          When I was a senior in high school, I was the only student in my class who did not have a driver license. The reason is that as an international student from China, I was not allowed to drive under the rules set by my foreign exchange program.

          But sometimes, certain senseless rules need to be broken. I felt restricted, and I really wanted to learn how to drive. When the restriction clashed with my rebellious nature, I broke the rule and drove.

          First, I passed the written test and got a learner's permit that was valid only for a month. Before I could hit the road, the remaining questions were: How can I get a vehicle ? Who can teach me how to drive?

          My host parents were not an option because they were affiliated with my exchange program. When I asked my most adventurous friend Palmer Kruzner if he could teach me how to drive his Jeep Wrangler, he reacted with an outright refusal and a mischievous smirk. Even the boldest friend of mine would not teach me how to drive, let alone others.
        </p>

        <p>
          As days went by, the expiration date of my permit was approaching. I had not even stepped my foot on a gas pedal. One day, as I was riding back home in a Uber, a light-bulb moment came across my desperate mind. Why not ask a Uber driver ?

          I tried twice. To my surprise, both times the drivers accepted my weird, unusual request.

          I had my first driving lesson with Dylan in his Honda Civic. After several minutes of conversation, we switched our seats. Under his instructions, I practiced a few basic drills at a parking lot and went on the main road. A week later, I met Thomas, a cautious retired senior who let me drive his Mercedez.

        </p>

        <p>
          Those two drivers must have been out of their mind. Why would they trust an unexperienced teenage driver who they just met ? It was not until now that I realized how I exactly got them to say yes.

          The ability to get others to say "yes" is a valuable skill to have in life. We need yeses in order to get into our dream college, land a dream job, seal a business contract, marry a loved one, pass a major legislation, and, of course, drive a stranger's car.

          We want yeses. They mean acceptance and approval. They feel good.

        </p>

        <p>
          To get yeses in life, we can employ different forms of tactics. We can show our competence. We can provide incentives. We can use manipulation, trickery, negotiation, bribery, coercion, flattery, etc.

          But, the best tactic to get yeses is to be 100% tactic free. The best way to get yeses is to be butt-ass naked. Yes, I mean butt-ass naked.

          After I hopped in the car, I was butt-ass naked about who I am and what I want. I shared my international background, my independent lifestyle with local hosts, and my determination to learn how to drive despite the rule and obstacle.

          I didn't beg or implore. I was just being this genuine, direct and quirky individual that I had always been. As I shared my personal experience with Dylan and Thomas, they were fascinated by my laid-back, wacky personality and even more so when I openly asked them for a driving lesson. As a result, both of them agreed to teach me with pleasure. After the lessons, when I offered cash to thank them, they declined my compensation. Back then, to me, the whole experience felt surreal and unbelievable. It still does.
        </p>

        <p>

          As an eighteen year old, I got two virtually impossible yeses from two elderly strangers. In retrospection, I attributed the success to my decision to be butt-ass naked about who I am and what I want. In other words, in order to get yeses from the drivers, I was being genuine and honest meanwhile showing my individual authenticity. That's what made me so convincing and compelling.

          Authenticity creates trust. Individuality catches interest. The combination of the two will culminate into something quite amazing and extraordinary.

          Be genuine. Be quirky. Yeses will arrive shortly.

       </p>
